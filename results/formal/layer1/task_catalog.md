# Layer 1 Task Catalog

This catalog is the compact Layer 1 agent-facing routing interface for BioHarness spatial transcriptomics work. It helps an agent choose one active `Analysis Problem` before opening Layer 2 method-selection material.

Current source of truth: the 2026-05-06 Layer 1/Layer 2 reconciliation and topic-confirmation status. Layer 1 records problem placement and routing only. It does not list methods, rank methods, expose method evidence, or make execution claims.

## Problem Routing Logic

Use the user's requested scientific object and target output first, then use available input signals to break ties.
